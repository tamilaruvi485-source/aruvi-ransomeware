# Simple Ransomware Simulator
## (Educational Use Only)

## Project Description
- This project is a Simple Ransomware Simulator created only for educational purposes.
- It demonstrates how ransomware encrypts files using cryptography techniques.
- The project is designed for learning and cybersecurity awareness.
- It does not harm real system files or personal data.
- The program works only on a sample test folder.

## Objective
- To understand the basic working principle of ransomware.
- To learn how file encryption works using Python.
- To simulate ransomware behavior in a safe and controlled environment.
- To improve knowledge in cybersecurity and ethical hacking concepts.

## Internship Context
- This project is developed as part of the RISE Internship.
- The project is submitted for academic and internship evaluation.
- The focus is on ethical learning and security awareness.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3 programming language.
- Cryptography module for encryption.
- Fernet symmetric encryption technique.

## Project Structure
- The project contains a main Python file.
- A test folder is used to store sample files.
- A README file is used to explain the project.
- Only the test folder files are processed by the program.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on the system.
- Cryptography library installed.
- Sample files placed inside the test folder.

## Working Methodology
- The program generates a secret encryption key.
- The generated key is saved for reference.
- The program scans the test folder.
- Files inside the test folder are read one by one.
- Each file is encrypted using Fernet encryption.
- Encrypted files become unreadable.
- Original files are removed after encryption.
- Encrypted files are saved with a .enc extension.

## Expected Output
- Before execution, files are in readable text format.
- After execution, files are encrypted successfully.
- Encrypted files contain random unreadable characters.
- The encryption process completes without affecting system files.

## Safety Measures
- The program works only on a sample test folder.
- No system or personal files are accessed.
- The program runs only when executed manually.
- No background execution or automatic spreading.

## Disclaimer
- This project is strictly created for educational purposes only.
- It is intended to demonstrate ransomware behavior in a controlled environment.
- The author does not support or promote any malicious activity.
- Misuse of this project for illegal purposes is strictly prohibited.
